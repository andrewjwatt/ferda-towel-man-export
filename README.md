I pulled all the players from yahoo sports, ran their last year stats through our league's scoring rules and got their total fantasy points from last year.

I added three columns: pts above replacement, bench, waivers

replacement just means the player directly below them in their position (Forward, Dman, Goalie). For instance, if Cale Makar has 80 pts and Hedman was after him and points at 78, Cale's points above replacement would be 2.

above bench, means based on 10 man league, each player has 4 d men playing at all time, compares that players points to "the best bench player"

above waiver, is pretty much the same, assumes that everyones bench will be 3 Forward, 2 Dmen, 1 Goalie, compares the player to "the best waiver player"
